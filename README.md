# Market Basket Optimization

This repository documents my personal project on Market Basket Optimization using the Apriori algorithm in Python. The project explores two different implementations:

## Apriori Algorithm with Apyori Package

In this approach, I utilized the `apyori` package to implement the Apriori algorithm. I performed data cleaning and preprocessing, then applied the Apriori algorithm to generate association rules. The results are presented in a dataframe and sorted based on lift values.

## Apriori Algorithm with mlxtend.frequent_patterns Package

Here, I leveraged the `mlxtend.frequent_patterns` package for Apriori algorithm implementation. After loading and preprocessing the dataset, I generated frequent itemsets and association rules. The association rules were filtered based on specific criteria and presented for analysis.

## Understanding the Results

This project provided insights into customer behavior and item associations, crucial for optimizing market baskets and improving business strategies. Key measures such as support, confidence, and lift were used to analyze association rules.

For detailed implementation and explanations, refer to the respective Jupyter Notebook files in this repository.

Feel free to explore and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement!
